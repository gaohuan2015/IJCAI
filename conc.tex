\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:con}
In this paper, we proposed TCE, a KG embedding model which is able to take advantages of the triple context in the graph. By defining two kinds of context of a triple and representing them in a unified framework, our model can learn embeddings that are aware of their context. We evaluate our model on link prediction and the experimental results show significant improvements over the major baselines.

In the future, we will research on the following aspects: (1) Conduct experiments on more data sets and tasks to validate our model. (2) Current results show complementarity to some other methods such as TransH, TransR. We would think about a combination of those methods and our model.
