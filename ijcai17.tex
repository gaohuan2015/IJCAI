\begin{abstract}
    Knowledge graph embedding can represents entities and relations with efficient low-dimensional embedding vectors. Due to the outstanding performance on knowledge graph completion has led to an increase in the knowledge graph embedding research. State-of-the-art approaches treat each triple independent and aim to learn a fixed context-free embedding and always neglect rich structure features in knowledge graph. In this paper, an Attentional-Triple-Context-based knowledge Embedding model(ATCE) for entities and relations in their local structures,which we refer to as \emph{triple context}, is proposed to take advantages of structures in knowledge graph. For each triple, two kinds of structure information are considered as its triple context in the graph: 1) Neighbor context is the outgoing relations and neighboring entities of an entity; 2) Path context is connective relation paths between a pair of entities, both of which contains rich useful information and unrelated information for entities and relations. In order to filter unrelated information, ATCE learns embedding for entities and relations with a attention mechanism and is expected to select the useful information in triple context. The experimental results show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for link prediction and entity prediction.
