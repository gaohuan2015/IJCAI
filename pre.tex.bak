\section{Preliminaries}\label{sec:pre}
In this section, we first introduce the background knowledge about knowledge base, association rule mining and type inference.
\subsection{Knowledge Base}
In this paper, we focus on those knowledge bases expressed with RDF statements. Each RDF statement is a triple in the the form $<s,p,o>$, where $s$, $p$ and $o$ indicate a subject, a property (or predicate) and an object respectively. For convenience, $o(s)$ is used if $p$ indicates ``rdf:type" which describes that the individual $s$ belongs to concept $o$, and $p(s,o)$ is used otherwise.

Usually, a KB consists of an $ABox$ and a $TBox$. The $ABox$ includes a set of facts describing instances and their relations. The $TBox$ defines the schema information like the relations between classes, domains and ranges of properties. Our task of this paper is to mine $TBox$ information from an $ABox$. It is noted that, we use the terms knowledge base and ontology interchangeable.

\subsection{Association Rule Mining}
Association rule mining\cite{HanK2012} is a rule-based method for discovering relations between variables in large databases by constructing transaction tables. Let $\mathcal{I}=\{I_1,I_2,...,I_m\}$ be a set of items. A set of items that contain $k$ items is called a $k$-itemset. Each transaction $T$ is a nonempty set of items such that $T\subseteq \mathcal{I}$. For a set $A$ satisfying $A\subseteq T$, the transaction $T$ is said to contain $A$. An association rule is an implication of the form $A\rightarrow B$, where $A\subset \mathcal{I}$, $B \subset \mathcal{I}$, $A\cap B=\emptyset$, $A$ and $B$ are nonempty.

To decide whether an association rule $A\rightarrow B$ holds or not, the measures of support and confidence are widely adopted.
\begin{left}
$support(A\rightarrow B)=P(A\cup B)$,\\
$confidence(A \rightarrow B)=P(B|A) =\dfrac{support(A\cup B)}{support(A)}. $
\end{left}
Usually, the support of $A\rightarrow B$ is an absolute support which takes the occurrence frequency of the itemset $\{A,B\}$  as its value. Sometimes, it is also defined as a relative support which is the ratio of the absolute support and the number of all transactions in the transaction table.
%
Confidence of $A\rightarrow B$ is the percentage of transactions containing $A$ that also contain $B$ according to the transaction table. This is taken to be the conditional probability.

From the equations we can see that, the problem of mining association rules can be reduced to that of mining frequent itemsets.

\subsection{Type Inference}
A RDF KB contains million facts, but it is still an incomplete KB in most cases. \cite{typeinference} is an statistic method to learn missing type assertions from a noisy RDF KB. For each property in a RDF KB, there is a characteristic distribution of types
for both the subject and the object. For example the property $dbpedia-owl:location$ is used in 247,601 triples in DBpedia.  $87\%$ objects of these triples are belong to $dbpedia-owl:Place$.  Furthermore, it uses statistic method to assign a certain weigh for each each property, which reflects its capability of predicting the type. Finally, the missing type can be inferred by the weight. because each inferred type assertion have a probability, in this paper, the inferred type assertions are named probabilistic type assertions (namely PTA).
